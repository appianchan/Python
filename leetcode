# Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

# Note:

# Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

# Example 1:

# Input: [2,2,1]
# Output: 1
# Example 2:

# Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
# Output: 4

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        obj = defaultdict(int)
        for x in nums:
                obj[x] += 1
        for y in obj:
            if obj[y] == 1:
                return y

                Given an array of integers A sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
# Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
# Example 2:

# Input: [-7,-3,2,3,11]
# Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
 

# Note:

# 1 <= A.length <= 10000
# -10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
# A is sorted in non-decreasing order.

class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, A: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        final = []
        for x in A:
            final.append(x * x)
        final.sort()
        return final


# Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
# Example 2:

# Input: arr = [1,2]
# Output: false
# Example 3:

# Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
# Output: true

class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        final = []
        obj = defaultdict(int)
        for x in arr:
            obj[x] += 1
        for y in obj:
            if obj[y] in final:
                return False
            else:
                final.append(obj[y])
        return True
        
# Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
# Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
# Example 2:

# Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
# Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        r = len(s)
        for x in range(0, r):
            # rawr = s.pop()
            s.insert(x, s.pop())
